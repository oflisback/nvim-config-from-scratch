# My neovim from scratch config

My config, not polished for sharing or anything try it at your own risk, not really prioritizing intended to share ðŸ¤·.

# My astronvim setup

I'm working on migrating to astronvim to leverage its usage of the lazy package manager and its reference community cofigurations.
That repo is here https://github.com/oflisback/astro-nvim-user.
